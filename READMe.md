# Introduction

This repository contains the code and report for a machine learning project focusing on image classification. The project explores the use of deep learning techniques, specifically Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify images into predefined categories. Two datasets, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, are utilized for training and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of the project is to develop deep learning models capable of accurately classifying images. Fashion-MNIST comprises grayscale images of fashion items, while CIFAR-10 consists of color images representing various objects. The project involves data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and result analysis.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: The datasets are prepared for training, involving normalization, resizing, and augmentation.
2. **Model Architecture Design**: MLP and CNN architectures are designed for image classification.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Models are trained using optimization algorithms and evaluated on separate test datasets.
4. **Results Analysis**: Performance metrics are computed, and challenges encountered are addressed.
5. **Code Implementation**: Python code using TensorFlow is implemented and shared in this repository.
